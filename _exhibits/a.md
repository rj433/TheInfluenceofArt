In the topic of what students value of the art they can expect to see around campus, they tend to think of paintings or photos to express themselves. When students aren't able to express themselves through words, they tend to flock to visual representations.

Paintings are objects full of color, direction, velocity, and emotion. These pieces are fleeting objects that can portray the painters emotions or experiences, captured in a moment in time. 

It is absolutely vital that students on a college campus are surrounded by pieces that they can resonate with, as they can use them for several purposes. They can be used to inspire creativity, create an environment of positive mental health, and allow students to find a place that can align with their interests.
