This art was collected in the grand scheme of introducing the topic of just how important art is for our lives, in all aspects. It is a key part of inspiring creativity, and improving the lives of those that come into contact with it. Through collecting these images, we have tried to emphasize just how important art is to the quality of life to the students on our campus. Created by Ryan Janoski, Alexandria Crayton, and Ashton Baumgartner: Ryan playing the role of technologist, Alexandria as the producer, and Ashton as the writer. We strive to ensure that art is given the platform it deserves to improve the lives of those that encounter it.
