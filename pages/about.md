About the project: Art is an important aspect of the Indiana University community. Several installations have been inputted across campus to add to the natural beauty of the environment. We decided to take the opportunity to view art installations around campus, and emphasize their importance to the life of an Indiana University student. We captured our individual expereinces of the pieces, and included our vision for what it resembles.
