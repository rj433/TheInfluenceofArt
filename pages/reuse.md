Wax is inspired by [FAIR data principles](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/13427), and as such strives to make its collections findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.

Our original metadata can be used in order to view all of the information that we gathered in list form. For example, if one wanted to view all of our data at the same time, they could use the metadata record.

With the metadata, the viewer can read our group's original thoughts on everything that was included in this exhibition.
