description: Sanford Robinson Gifford's masterful rendering of a fiery sunset transforms
  this genre subject of ice skaters frozen on a pond. A critic who saw the painting
  at Gifford's studio in 1862 remarked it was one of the artist's "happiest efforts..."
  with its still, dream-like beauty.
comment: 'Seeing art like this may expose the viewer to subjects of great interest
  as they may seek inspiration to express themselves through their works. Many find
  it beneficial to express themselves through vast landscapes, versus using words. '
