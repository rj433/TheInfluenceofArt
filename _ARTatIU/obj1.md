description: 'A rich Prussian blue frames the head of Alexei von Jawlensky''s Old
  Man, providing a vivid contrast to the bright colors of his face. Although it evokes
  a Russian icon, this portait, depicts a local gardener. '

  for great detail whilst maintaining vivid color. Seeing this picture helps the viewer
  understand that through art, they can express creativity and make something beautiful.
