description: 'Waves crash as sunlight breaks through stormy clouds in the view of
  Grand Manan Island, off the coast of Maine. Markedly different from the tranquil
  scenes Alfred Thompson Bricher normally painted, this stormy seascape embodies the
  Romantic concept of the "sublime", which refers to the awe-inspiring qualities of
  the natural world. '
comment: 'Sometimes when we are going through turbulent times, it is best to express
  how we are feeling. With some it may be easier to express ourselves through images.
  Creating a dangerous, intense, and serious environment can show how we are feeling
  and can allow ourselves to express our feelings in a creative and productive way. '
